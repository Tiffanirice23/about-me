### Reflections and Comments

#### Lab03 Reflections
> In this lab, I added 2 additional user questions with `for` and `while` loops! In one question, I added a "too high" or "two low!" response to incorrect questions, and allowed a max of 4 attempts. On the second question, I added an array of items for the user to guess with 6 total attemps! Lastly, I added a results array that would display the user's overall score!
